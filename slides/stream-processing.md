### "Fast data" applications: stream processing and routing

* stream processors can get at ingested events in real-time without an intermediate persistence step
 * faster than a database - database-reindex - query round-trip
 * more scalable

* Platform services already exist
 * [Amazon Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/) 
 * [Microsoft Azure Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/event-hubs/)
