## To conclude â€¦ 

* Spatial technologies are *highly relevant* to mass event ingestion applications
* This use case ends up requiring different technologies
 * Still quite complex, immature and fast-moving 
* Less emphasis on persistent storage (the "single point of truth")
* Geodatabase know-how will be transferable to spatial stream processing
