### Telemetry and event ingestion

* Telemetry or *distant measurement* can mean *lots of events*
* Let's take a modest logistics example: 
 * A fleet of 300 vehicles with location data transmitted twice a minute
 * 36,000 events per hour
 * About a million events per dayâ€”too much for a database-backed application

* Platform services already exist
 * [Amazon Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/) 
 * [Microsoft Azure Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/event-hubs/)
